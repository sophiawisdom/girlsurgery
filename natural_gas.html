What is natural gas?
Natural gas is another name for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane">Methane</a>, a gaseous hydrocarbon.

Why does anyone care about natural gas?
Natural gas is the cheapest, cleanest, most controllable fuel out there. If you need raw energy, this is your best option.

What is natural gas used for?
In the US, natural gas is used for electricity (40%), heating for homes and businesses (25%) and heat for industrial
processes (25%). The remainder is used to get the natural gas itself. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_sum_lsum_dcu_nus_a.htm"> source </a>.
About a third of all US energy comes from natural gas.

Why is natural gas used for electricity?

Why is natural gas used for heating homes?

Why is natural gas used for industrial heat?

How is natural gas produced?
There are rocks in the ground, thousands of feet deep and tens to hundreds of feet thick, that have substantial quantities of
natural gas. The gas is extracted by fracturing the rocks with water (fracking). This is the source of ~75% of US natural gas.

How big is the Natural Gas market?
In the US, $170B/y. Outside the US ~$500B. Total is similar to Google + Apple combined. Seaborne LNG trade is $200-400B/y.
Footnote: these are all wholesale figures

How much does natural gas cost?
In the US, wholesale [henry hub] is $4/mcf <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdm.htm"> source</a>.
"City Gate" prices (price at which they're sold to municipal utilities from national system)
are $4.50/mcf on average <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_a_EPG0_PG1_DMcf_m.htm"> source </a>.
Industrial prices are similar. Commercial prices average ~$11/mcf and residential prices average $20/mcf.
As you can see, the vast majority of cost for residences is not the cost of the underlying gas, but the transport infrastructure.

What is a MCF?
One mcf = 1000 cubic feet of natural gas. This has almost exactly one million BTUs of heat when burned.
It is the customary unit of natural gas pricing. It is equivalent to 8.6 gallons of gasoline or 1/6 of a barrel of oil.
Wholesale natural gas costs $21 for the equivalent energy of a barrel of oil (currently $57).

Where is natural gas produced?
Natural

What is LNG?
LNG stands for "Liquefied Natural Gas". At room temperature, natural gas takes up a lot of space and is difficult to transport.
It's 38MJ of energy per cubic meter, compared to 33,000MJ per cubic meter of gasoline. This is totally unworkable, and so for
a long time there was no transport of natural gas. In recent decades, LNG has been exploding.
With LNG, natural gas is cooled to a very low temperature (-162˚C), which makes it a liquid with a density 600x greater,
now only 30% less dense than gasoline.
Converting natural gas into a liquid is quite expensive, $3/mcf + a 15% energy cost. That means liquefying natural gas costs
as much as it does to make the natural gas in the first place in the US! Asian LNG cargoes go for $10/mmbtu, so right now exporting
LNG is quite profitable (Venture Global, a US LNG exporter, <a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/vg/statistics/">is worth $50B</a>).
