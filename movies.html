  <h2 class="film-title">The Boys in the Band</h2>
  <p class="film-meta">1970 release • watched 2020 • 5 stars</p>
  <p class="review-text">what a fantastic movie. you&#x27;re thrown out of society and hate yourself for it so seek comfort in the people who were also thrown out, but the way you hate yourself forces you to lash out at everyone around you constantly in ways that cause them to explode. this kind of intense cycle of self hatred. i prefer this over the remake because it&#x27;s a huge point that they are ugly! they are old! the &quot;fairy&quot; character looks mannish! not like a twink. i think trans women get these kinds of dynamics as well. a great exposition of something i hadn&#x27;t seen before</p>

  <h2 class="film-title">Heartworn Highways</h2>
  <p class="film-meta">1976 release • watched 2019 • 4.5 stars</p>
  <p class="review-text">originally watched this movie because the clips of various songs that made their way to youtube, especially waiting around to die. several of the songs show a really interesting portrait of communal life of adults at that time, esp. bluebird wine. some of the songs were deeply affecting, especially these performances and having some context on e.g. the blacksmith. some of the songs with accompaniment like that old time feeling or the one where they&#x27;re in the bus are substantially improved in film form. but mostly i think this is best watched as a series of clips on youtube.</p>

  <h2 class="film-title">Inside Man</h2>
  <p class="film-meta">2006 release • watched 02/16/2026 • 4 stars</p>
  <p class="review-text">Really fun. All the characters were smart and knew what they were doing and it created a compelling story. I underestimated the detective at the beginning but he pulled it out in a good way, really made me root for him. The criminals came in with a foolproof plan but the detective managed to outsmart them -- but not completely. The reveal at the end was great. The middle was somewhat too slow. The detective fought for justice in a way that felt really admirable. Even small things were good -- after they wrecked the mayor they laughed about it afterward! they said wow we smoked that guy. felt realistic.</p>
