        <li> <details> <summary> Systems that push risk to the limit </summary> There are certain classes of systems where when we endeavor to reduce the inherent riskiness of systems in order to then immediately plow that into some kind of fundamental risk/reward tradeoff.<br><br>In modern finance, a central insight is that a low-risk low-reward asset can be turned into a high-risk high-reward asset by just borrowing more money. A trade that is guaranteed to return 1% more than the treasuries is worth more than a risky one that returns on average 6% more than treasuries because the safer the investment is the more I can lever up. This is one of the central innovations of money managers to my mind, which is actually working hard to keep portfolio risk down which in turn means you can borrow much more.<br><br> There's a weirdly similar. dynamic in ML training where we want to make our learning rate as high as possible, but this makes our model training unstable. So we want our learning rate to be as high as possible without causing instability. The central insight of methods like shampoo is to "pre-condition" (get it) the gradient so it's less likely to become unstable as we increase the learning rate, which gain we immediately spend on increasing the learning rate and making training more unstable. </details> </li>

        <li> <details> <summary>What does it mean to be skilled?</summary> How does being skilled change you? Often the answer in history for why one group triumphed over another is the skill of a single person (Rockefeller, Napoleon, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Mattei">Enrico Mattei</a>), but <abbr title="except for generals">they rarely explain what that means</abbr>. Why was Rockefeller able to run more efficient refineries than any of his competitors? People often just say he was better, but what did that actually entail? One clue is that he actually looked at what expenses were and managed them in a way nobody else did at the time. I wish I understood this about everyone.<br><a href="https://x.com/rmbalt/status/1671951288483938331">Here's a small example of skill in making memes</a> -- the meme maker is so good the meme is *better* than the source material it draws from.</details> </li>
        <li> <details><summary>Why are some people and organizations more efficient than others with the same resources?</summary> The best example I have right now is Google's Ad organization vs Meta's Ad organization, where Meta is ~3 years behind due to, as far as I can tell, not believing in compute for several years (e.g. many of their production models are not just inferenced on CPU, but <i>trained</i> on CPU). Apparently this costs them ~20-40% of revenue. That's totally fucking insane! Tens of billions of dollars of lost opportunity. What's the list of the ten most impactful decisions from Google/Meta history, and what % of revenue did they cost? <!--How much does quality of execution like this actually matter? <a href="https://danluu.com/hardware-unforgiving/#2021-comments">Is it all just about PMF?</a> thinking about twitter vs facebook and the danluu post about how maybe it was because of poor execution--></details> </li>

                <li> thinking longer in chess regularly improves your skill by ~50 elo for every doubling of time. That's incredible! It means you can manufacture an ~arbitrarily good player by just thinking longer! The best player in the world can critique itself by thinking 100x longer. </li>
                <li> Chess engines are typically architected as a search engine for the best move on top of an algorithm to evaluate how good a position is. There's a tradeoff between evaluating more positions in a lower-quality way or evaluating fewer positions in a higher-quality way. Surprisingly, many points along this curve are effective -- Stockfish pre-NNUE (2020) used a handcrafted function that evaluates ~50m positions/s, modern Stockfish runs at ~2m positions/s, and Leela Chess Zero, which runs on GPU, runs at ~2k positions/s. </li>
                <li> LLM tradeoffs between size and quality are interesting because the pareto frontier is moving so quickly. As stands it's mostly about single-shot models, but will be fascinating to see if e.g. agents can make a poor model a good one. </li>
                <li> In stock market trading, there's a relationship between latency and the complexity of signals. Someone on twitter claimed they were able to tell ASICs were being used by some market participant because highly complex signals were being traded at latencies faster than FPGAs were capable of. That's fascinating. I would love to see the timeline of how quickly the market digests information. How many "bps of alpha per ms" do we see the market improve by? </li>

Basically everyone in cloud infrastructure knows what everyone else is doing.

Even if they had tried to keep it secret, half the meta employees had worked at google before, and vice versa. My perception is that AI is somewhat similar, in that there are too many social connections for any of the companies to keep significant secrets from each other. <br>To what degree are other industries this tight-knit? Is it advantageous or disadvantageous for industries to be like this? To what degree can secrets actually be kept in a whole industry? </details></li>

        <li> <details><summary><a href="https://x.com/cis_female/status/1790141729082864097">Why are retail options spreads so high? </a> </summary> My personal feeling is that spreads for any retail financial product should be essentially 0, because retail traders have no advantage (ignoring e.g. GME/AMC). But in fact we often see options spreads of 5% or more for options on relatively common stocks. Some of this is that Robinhood shows bid/ask numbers from exchanges and price improvement happens later (pointed out by @theemilyaccount). Another part is that retail options might go to an exchange more than retail stocks (though somehow robinhood made $150m last quarter on options revenue). My current theory is that internalizing retail options takes a lot of capital and skill, so there's less competition than for equities, which means spreads are wider and robinhood/market makers can take more of the price improvement. </details> </li>

                <li> Why are there regularly negative electricity prices in the US? Why don't people curtail more?</li>
                Basic answer is approximately "many plants are expensive to turn off for a short period of time" + production-based tax credits for wind and solar that encourage them to produce even when they have to pay money to do so.
            <li> Why did nuclear energy capacity factors go from <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_article_width/public/2022-06/chart-title.png?itok=jorBkYE1">~70% to ~90% between 1990 and 2003</a>? </li>
            Answered by <a href="https://x.com/Vernon3Austin"> Austin Vernon </a>: "Nuclear power plant capacity factor went up because of countless small improvements, slightly modified equipment, better operations management, etc. Also NRC got more flexible with performance based regulation. [This] kind of performance increase is relatively normal for factories, chemical plants, and power plants."

    <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_f00f0OVsc">Nearer To Thee</a>. It sweeps me away. It makes me feel one with the crowd. It makes me believe in god. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HookiS1BmY">Clipo clipo</a>. It's feels insane that a song this deeply affecting is about a topic so obscure to me (apparently Ivorian independence). </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28BFJ_TgiK8">Undone in sorrow</a>. Prototypical short story, played with candor. It feels like the sort of trap I could fall into, the song I could be singing. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_4N05coN2g">Tumble in the Wind</a>. The songwriter's history strongly influences my understanding of songs like these. This man's life is full of tragedy and sorrow. This song is too. The beginning makes my heart sway, powerfully moves my chest to beat with him. Also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzF09zbEbxI">Box Canyon</a> by him. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC3eDwpVn6M">Fireflies Made Out of Dust</a>. I can't explain this one yet. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_dO7sUZI9g">Western Island</a>. A real, compelling vision of a life of solitude. I could live on a western island. I need to feel the ground. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTfmUAg0AGM"> Freak Show</a>. I find this song deeply disgusting. A connection to a world and a group of people I used to know. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuNBLjJzRoo"> 90210 </a>. To me this song is about walking slick, rainy streets late at night without a friend for a thousand miles. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVkD4lgXTEU"> Bones in the Ocean</a>. One of the songs I listened to <a href="/colorado.jpeg">wandering in Colorado</a>. I made a Finnish friend there, and then she said she wanted to kill all the rationalists. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7khrDCCiHo"> Daddies</a>. Rocking, makes my body sway, brings me into the music.</li>
