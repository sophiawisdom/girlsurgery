        <li> <details><summary> What sorts of moral obligation do I have wrt AGI? </summary>I have contributed a nonzero amount to the development of AI systems by selling AI companies data. I currently plan to do more of this. Is this bad? Should I not do this? The most important question is whether the current generation of LLM systems will reach AGI/ASI. My current belief is that this will not happen, though it's very unclear. I've committed to not selling to labs I consider immoral going forward. I'm also going to donate to pro-safety candidates. I think that's enough for the moment, but I could be wrong. As a final note, there are many thoughts I have on this topic that I can't write down for various reasons. </details>  </li>

        <li> <details><summary> What should I do in my retirement? </summary> I made a few million dollars selling datasets. This means I don't have to work ever again if I don't want to. I dislike work an unusual amount and am generally somewhat frugal. My main goal in earning money is to buy my time. Currently I am still working because I think the expected value of my time working is fairly high. Several friends have told me that I'm actually just going to continue working for a long time and this is not real retirement. I disagree because I think i have a real track record of not working for extended periods of time. I think it's highly plausible that I will do things that make money in the future, things like teaching GPU programming class for example.

            <br> Some things I would like to do in retirement:
            <ul>
                <li> Make a better GPU chess engine with Leelachess </li>
                <li> Learn more about mining. Visit mining conferences </li>
                <li> Actually reach the Jhanas in a consistent way </li>
                <li> Spend more time on dating </li>
                <li> Go to college classes at Berkeley, esp on history/theology. </li>
                <li> Read more history books. By default my consumption of historical information is highly frenetic, which is great for breadth but terrible for breadth. </li>
                <li> Play more sports. Climb more seriously perhaps? Actually try to get better? Want to get better at dancing too. </li>
                <li> Try to understand trading in general better. Maybe work on a crypto marketmaking bot or something like that? Some kind of solana arb? </li>
                <li> Try to understand theology better, read the bible front to end. </li>
                <li> Get my drivers license, spend time in the desert </li>
                <li> Write STT inference kernels + API for parakeet 1.3b </li>
                <li> Actually understand modern compression systems </li>
                <li> Finish up wisewords and see if there are any gains on small model inference </li>
                <li> Try to pick up some kind of physical craft. Maybe making clothes? Maybe blacksmithing or pottery? Not really sure. </li>
                <li> Try to pick up the guitar so I can play and sing old folk songs </li>
                <li> Voice train </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li> <details><summary> Why do I feel ~no sexual pleasure? </summary> Physically I don't receive much pleasure from having sex, relative to others, though it's hard to calibrate what other people are feeling to my feelings. Evidence I don't feel much: most people like having sex much more than I do, people describe needing to have sex in a way I don't, they describe like massive physical pleasure on orgasm which I don't have, you can see peoples physical reactions to doing sexual things. I find it intellectually interesting and compelling. I enjoy reading erotica, for example. Often the erotica most interesting to me is orgasm denial stuff, because of the focus on desperate craving for this overwhelmingly valuable thing. When I have even orgasms that involuntarily cause my toes to curl it feels very much whatever. I masturbate like once a week and it mostly feels vaguely disgusting, like I'm compelled to do it. This is a tricky situation to be in because 1&#41; it seems hard to sustain romantic/intimate relationships without sex and 2&#41; it's sad that a massive field of human enjoyment feels closed off to me. I'm not really sure how to go about having a good time here. Sometimes I've enjoyed butt stuff alone in the past but man it's so annoying to deal with. </li>

        this isn't exactly true
        <li> <details> <summary> Systems that push risk to the limit </summary> There are certain classes of systems where when we endeavor to reduce the inherent riskiness of systems in order to then immediately plow that into some kind of fundamental risk/reward tradeoff.<br><br>In modern finance, a central insight is that a low-risk low-reward asset can be turned into a high-risk high-reward asset by just borrowing more money. A trade that is guaranteed to return 1% more than the treasuries is worth more than a risky one that returns on average 6% more than treasuries because the safer the investment is the more I can lever up. This is one of the central innovations of money managers to my mind, which is actually working hard to keep portfolio risk down which in turn means you can borrow much more.<br><br> There's a weirdly similar. dynamic in ML training where we want to make our learning rate as high as possible, but this makes our model training unstable. So we want our learning rate to be as high as possible without causing instability. The central insight of methods like shampoo is to "pre-condition" (get it) the gradient so it's less likely to become unstable as we increase the learning rate, which gain we immediately spend on increasing the learning rate and making training more unstable. </details> </li>

        <li> <details> <summary>What does it mean to be skilled?</summary> How does being skilled change you?

Why was Rockefeller able to run more efficient refineries than any of his competitors? People often just say he was better, but what did that actually entail? One clue is that he actually looked at what expenses were and managed them in a way nobody else did at the time. I wish I understood this about everyone.<br><a href="https://x.com/rmbalt/status/1671951288483938331">Here's a small example of skill in making memes</a> -- the meme maker is so good the meme is *better* than the source material it draws from.</details> </li>

Apparently this costs them ~20-40% of revenue. That's totally fucking insane! Tens of billions of dollars of lost opportunity. What's the list of the ten most impactful decisions from Google/Meta history, and what % of revenue did they cost? <!--How much does quality of execution like this actually matter? <a href="https://danluu.com/hardware-unforgiving/#2021-comments">Is it all just about PMF?</a> thinking about twitter vs facebook and the danluu post about how maybe it was because of poor execution--></details> </li>

            <p style="margin: 0px;">
                Most people fall in to a career and default to working 40 hours/week for the rest of their lives and *then* think about how to spend the money.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0px;">
                I don't like working. Most people don't. I have structured my life to maximize freedom from the desires of others. It would be much better for you to have clear goals and intentions on how to live your life, and then choose your work to accomplish these goals with the least amount of pain. FIRE is a good example of this, though you can go much further.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0px;">
                A shining example of living with intention is groups like the <a href="https://www.carmelitemonks.org/">Carmelite monks of Wyoming</a>. If you look at <a href="https://www.carmelitemonkshorarium.org/">their schedule</a> they spend ~8 hours praying, 8 hours sleeping, and ~5.5 hours working (rest eating/recreation). Much of their work is devoted to the construction of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxiwEEhcZX0">a massive Gothic church</a>. They make money from the outside world with <a href="https://www.mysticmonkcoffee.com/">Mystic Monk Coffee</a>.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0px;">
                They have specific goals in mind: communion with god, living in brotherhood, building beautiful things. They suborn themselves to commerce and the desires of others exactly as much as is necessary to accomplish those goals.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0px;">
                What would this look like for you? How could you live in brotherhood with your friends and build beautiful things together, like a family, or a village?

        <li><details> <summary> Monk tax law </summary>
            <p style="margin: 0px;">
                In US tax law, there are heavy taxes on "income". Most of the fighting is about what exactly "income" is. If you work for a company and receive non-money things that have some value (e.g. a company apartment) this is considered "income" and you will be taxed, because you receive it in exchange for work.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0px;">
                Monks have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ora_et_labora">required to work</a> for 1500 years. Some of this work is praying or maintenance but traditionally they have had "side businesses", selling e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartreuse_(liqueur)">Chartreuse</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer">beer</a>. The order provides housing, healthcare, food, etc. for the monks. But these benefits are not considered "income" because it is not done <em>in exchange</em> for work. But this is a subtle distinction. If you stop working one day, you will be kicked out of the order and no longer receive benefits, just like a job. The distinction is that if you <em> cannot </em> work, e.g. for health reasons, then you still receive the benefits.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0px;">
                Think about how thin of a distinction that is, economically! 98% of your life you are required to work and in exchange you receive benefits. But because 2% of the time you receive benefits without work, it's no longer income and you don't have to pay taxes. They don't have to pay corporate/UBIT taxes for the same "not compensation" reasons and don't pay property taxes either. For a software engineer this is a ~2x increase in after-tax income.
            </p>

            There are some subtleties here that I'm happy to talk about IRL.

                <li> thinking longer in chess regularly improves your skill by ~50 elo for every doubling of time. That's incredible! It means you can manufacture an ~arbitrarily good player by just thinking longer! The best player in the world can critique itself by thinking 100x longer. </li>
                <li> Chess engines are typically architected as a search engine for the best move on top of an algorithm to evaluate how good a position is. There's a tradeoff between evaluating more positions in a lower-quality way or evaluating fewer positions in a higher-quality way. Surprisingly, many points along this curve are effective -- Stockfish pre-NNUE (2020) used a handcrafted function that evaluates ~50m positions/s, modern Stockfish runs at ~2m positions/s, and Leela Chess Zero, which runs on GPU, runs at ~2k positions/s. </li>
                <li> LLM tradeoffs between size and quality are interesting because the pareto frontier is moving so quickly. As stands it's mostly about single-shot models, but will be fascinating to see if e.g. agents can make a poor model a good one. </li>
                <li> In stock market trading, there's a relationship between latency and the complexity of signals. Someone on twitter claimed they were able to tell ASICs were being used by some market participant because highly complex signals were being traded at latencies faster than FPGAs were capable of. That's fascinating. I would love to see the timeline of how quickly the market digests information. How many "bps of alpha per ms" do we see the market improve by? </li>

As a summary for those who are unfamiliar, the GSEs take mortgages that meet some specifications and insure them against non-payment risk in return for a <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov/reports/single-family-guarantee-fees/2022">0.6% fee</a>. <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/Housing_Finance_At_A_Glance_Monthly_Chartbook_March_2024.pdf">2/3s</a> of mortgage debt in the US is insured in this manner. Mortgages that have been insured in this way trade at essentially the same price as US treasury debt, indicating the market believes the government will step in in case of significant non-payment, which seems true. But the GSEs are highly profitable (<a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/fourth-quarter-full-year-2023-financial-results">$2</a><a href="https://www.freddiemac.com/investors/financials/pdf/2023er-4q23_release.pdf">8B</a> in 2023) with enough assets (or enough assets after a few years years of retaining profits (which it doesn't do because treasury sweeps them)) to withstand even a 2008-level event.

But in fact we often see options spreads of 5% or more for options on relatively common stocks. Some of this is that Robinhood shows bid/ask numbers from exchanges and price improvement happens later (pointed out by @theemilyaccount). Another part is that retail options might go to an exchange more than retail stocks (though somehow robinhood made $150m last quarter on options revenue). My current theory is that internalizing retail options takes a lot of capital and skill, so there's less competition than for equities, which means spreads are wider and robinhood/market makers can take more of the price improvement. </details> </li>

            When large-scale serious enterprises ship products in AOT-compiled languages like C++, they compile with Profile Guided Optimization. The idea is that if the compiler knows exactly how hot or cold every function/branch is, it can do massive reorganizations to improve performance. Commonly the gain of PGO+LTO+BOLT-style stuff can be 20%+. The

                <li> Why are there regularly negative electricity prices in the US? Why don't people curtail more?</li>
                Basic answer is approximately "many plants are expensive to turn off for a short period of time" + production-based tax credits for wind and solar that encourage them to produce even when they have to pay money to do so.
            <li> Why did nuclear energy capacity factors go from <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_article_width/public/2022-06/chart-title.png?itok=jorBkYE1">~70% to ~90% between 1990 and 2003</a>? </li>
            Answered by <a href="https://x.com/Vernon3Austin"> Austin Vernon </a>: "Nuclear power plant capacity factor went up because of countless small improvements, slightly modified equipment, better operations management, etc. Also NRC got more flexible with performance based regulation. [This] kind of performance increase is relatively normal for factories, chemical plants, and power plants."

    <ul style="flex: 1;">
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_f00f0OVsc">Nearer To Thee</a>. It sweeps me away. It makes me feel one with the crowd. It makes me believe in god. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HookiS1BmY">Clipo clipo</a>. Feels like being held by a mother. It's feels insane that a song this deeply affecting is about a topic so obscure to me (apparently Ivorian independence). </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28BFJ_TgiK8">Undone in sorrow</a>. Prototypical short story, played with candor. It feels like the sort of trap I could fall into, the song I could be singing. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_4N05coN2g">Tumble in the Wind</a>. The songwriter's history strongly influences my understanding of songs like these. This man's life is full of tragedy and sorrow. This song is too. The beginning makes my heart sway, powerfully moves my chest to beat with him. Also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzF09zbEbxI">Box Canyon</a> by him. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC3eDwpVn6M">Fireflies Made Out of Dust</a>. I can't explain this one yet. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_dO7sUZI9g">Western Island</a>. A real, compelling vision of a life of solitude. I could live on a western island. I need to feel the ground. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTfmUAg0AGM"> Freak Show</a>. I find this song deeply disgusting. A connection to a world and a group of people I used to know. </li>
        <!--<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuNBLjJzRoo"> 90210</a>. To me this song is about walking slick, rainy streets late at night without a friend for a thousand miles. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVkD4lgXTEU"> Bones in the Ocean</a>. One of the songs I listened to <a href="/colorado.jpeg">wandering in Colorado</a>. I made a Finnish friend there, and then she said she wanted to kill all the rationalists. </li>-->
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7khrDCCiHo"> Daddies</a>. Rocking, makes my body sway, brings me into the music.</li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2020/07-breaking-strain---bitter-wind--2020-12-20-020459.mp3"> Hymn to the Breaking Strain </a> Makes me feel like a human being. The recording is hauntingly off-kilter choral singing over the internet.
        </li>
        <li> <a href="https://x.com/bashu_thanks/status/1805350598918693329"> La Noyée </a> The pinnacle of energy, of life, of feeling </li>
        <li> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1saCKTst3kjchoiNkwt3el?si=12f6507d2a4d4f3c"> Mishima's closing</a>. <a href="https://x.com/cis_female/status/1970424311606583365">Makes me want to kill myself at the sunrise</a>. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uRZYNcYR-w"> Oh I'm a Good Ol' Rebel</a>. Feels like actual defiance. Defiance in our culture is mostly pathetic. People who don't really believe, don't really care, give in immediately. This is actual defiance. I hate you, I hate everything you stand for, I will destroy you. And they won! They won for 100 years! Even in the face of a decade-long full occupation. I have a complicated relationship with songs of the old south. Their ideology was repugnant. But these were my ancestors. I cannot totally disavow them. </li>

    <!-- i want it to be a bunch of boxes with the text in the box and they are all kind of bumping in to each other -->
    <!-- would be cool to show physical locations -->
    <ul>
        <li>
            The top of Bernal Heights. Looking out over the twinkling lights. Seeing the purple lights, always in the same place. Taking off my clothes and giggling. Trying to climb the fence. Musing with my friends walking down to the rocky humps. Scampering in the darkness up the concrete-bag-ladder you're not supposed to touch.
        </li>
        <li>
            The walk between my house and the bus to go to work. A deeply hewn psychic path. Sprinting to try to make it. Getting the timing quite right.
        </li>
        <li>
            Walking down St. Charles street in New Orleans, feeling vague dread at how closed off the city is to me.
        </li>
        <li>
            Running through the woods outside school desperately trying to reason through whether I was trans. A season later sitting serenely in the snow.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scootering through Golden Gate Park on acid at new years daybreak, the colors unnaturally saturated, everything feeling too wonderful, wind streaming past my face.
        </li>
        <li>
            The purple lights off Twin Peaks, seeing them up close for the first time after crying walking home for two hours and feeling that there was more.

            like Caroline Polachek in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn3cHUtNZKo">this video</a>. In clear response to the beat, exact fluid, creative.

    <p> Some clothes I've made myself have been fun. </li>
        There is a theme I like very much, of pretending not to understand something and making a stupid point that is in actuality a joke that other people don't understand. Now that I say it like this I suppose that's cruel.  In this case the joke is that it says "Your Gay", which leads people to believe I'm retarded because I'm making a peurile joke and misspelling it, but then in harder to see letters it says "mine too, date me", which i think is amusing. I also like that it looks retarded because of my poor writing. Shockingly I painted this 6 years ago and there's been ~no damage since that time.
