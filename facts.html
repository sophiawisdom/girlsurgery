    <li> Originally the Jews did not care about authorship. Later they were influenced by the Greeks and attributed authorship of the Torah to Moses, the closest figure. There are minor obvious problems with this (Moses dies in the Torah) but solvable. Starting in the 1800s, secular scholars realized the Torah must have been written by multiple authors: there's different verbiage ("Yahweh" vs "Elohim"), multiple tellings of the same stories (two gensis stories), etc. The evidence has mounted to the point this is ~incontrovertible. But it puts sincere Christians in a bind, because <b>Jesus explicitly attributes the Torah to Moses</b>, and his word is dispositive. So they have to get creative with their interpretations. I find this interesting because there's a question of serious scholarship done by people who sort of cannot take their scholarship seriously because of their religious commitments. </li>
