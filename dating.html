<h1 style="text-align: center;"> I, Sophia Wisdom, am looking for a partner. </h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Could it be you? </h2>

<h2> Life situation </h3>
<p>
I am a bisexual 25 year old transgender woman-adjacent person.
</p>
<p>
I live alone in the mission district of San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
I am not currently working<sup id="working"><a href="#working">more</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
I am monogamous.
</p>
<p>
I want kids but am willing to compromise on this if it's not possible for us to have kids.
</p>

<h3> Who am I </h3>
I am a silly person.

I care deeply about excellence.

I care deeply about understanding.

I care deeply about computers.

I am deeply ADHD.
<!--I care about frugality. I don't really love working and purchases are paid for with my time. I'm intellectually attracted to being a "scavenger" and making better use of spare resources -- spare computing, spare electricity, spare housing.-->

<h3> Things I care about </h3>
<ul>
    <li> Laughter; Joy </li>
    <li> Excellence, doing well </li>
    <li> Understanding, saying true things </li>
</ul>

I care about being good at things. I want you to be really good at things. I want to watch and admire you be good at things.

<h3> Things I want out of a relationship </h3>
<p>
I want love. I want companionship. I want to build a life with you.
</p>
<p>
I want kids. I've been watching my friend's now-two-year-old as he's grown up. He's very cute.
</p>
<p>
I'm looking for something monogamous, or monagam-ish. I love my friends. I like to be able to snuggle them. I would be sad if I was in a relationship where this was not possible.
</p>
<p>
I'm not really huge on sex at the moment. This is plausibly fixable with the right partner. I'm vaguely switchy when I have done sex stuff.
</p>

<h3> Traits I care about </h3>
<ul>
    <li> Kind </li>
    <li> Intelligent </li>
    <li> Interesting/surprising/creative </li>
    <li> Appreciation for the profound </li>
</ul>

<h3>What my friends say about me</h3>

</p>

<p>
Aspen Smith: "holy shit sophia"
</p><p>
"you have literally one of the best artistic and aesthetic sensibilities of anyone i know"
</p><p>
"<a href="/website_vibes">https://girl.surgery/website_vibes/</a> is one of the most compelling works of art I've seen in ages"
</p>

<h3 id="working">Working</h3>
<p>
I've previously worked as a programmer at a bunch of different places. I had a good idea a few months ago and have been working on selling it. So far this has been pretty successful and it's looking like I'm not going to have to work for a while (probably 3-5 years).
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the mean time I've been figuring out what to do with my time. I'm working on a GPU programming class and have made some progress with pedagogy. I'm planning to drop in on <a href="https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-spring-history-118c-001-lec-001"> two</a> <a href="https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-spring-celtic-173-001-lec-001">classes</a> at UC Berkeley this semester. Other Things I Want To Do:
<ul>
    <li> Dance class</li>
    <li> Play more sports: Tennis, {Soft,Base}ball, ping pong?</li>
    <li> Read and understand more </li>
    <li> Possibly work on programming projects </li>
    <li> Spend time with you </li>
    <li> Maybe travel? I'm pretty traveled-out </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Dealbreakers</h3>
Some things about me that might be Dealbreakers for you
<ul>
    <li> I can be very avoidant. This has been catastrophic before in my career and personal life. </li>
    <li> I often have trouble keeping up with housework. My room is often very messy for example. </li>
    <li> I can be very stubborn if I don't agree with you. For example Typed has tried to Fix me many times but has mostly not succeeded. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Emotions</h3>
Sometimes I get powerful emotions. Power roiling through me. I've written about this on <a href="/"> my main website </a>. I am likely mildly bipolar -- hypomania for a while with more reclusive periods.

<h3 id="desiderata"> Desiderata </h3>
<h4> Appearance </h4> I'm 6'3 and weigh ~160lbs. You can find photos of me on <a href="/">my main page</a>
<h4> Drugs </h4>
I used to do LSD fairly often. I don't nearly as much now. I don't smoke and I drink maybe once a month. I'm in general not very into drugs at the moment but I'm down to try if you're into them.
<h4>Twitter</h4> I spend a lot of time on <a href="https://x.com/cis_female">twitter</a> and a lot of my social scene is from there.
</ul>

<h3> Relationship references </h3>
I've had two partners in the past, both of whom I still talk to. The last one is probably willing to talk to you if you want a reference; her name is <a href="https://x.com/charonoire">Vivien Nepenthe</a>.
<!--My main goal with this is to credibly demonstrate that past relationships were overall good and I'm not e.g. abusive.-->
