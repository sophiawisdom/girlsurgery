Some basic dating information about me, Sophia Wisdom.

<h3> Who am I </h3>
I care deeply about excellence. (TODO: ref: and I care about it in a relationship as well. Is this too rude to put in?)

I care deeply about understanding.

I care deeply about computers.

I am deeply ADHD.
I care about frugality. I don't really love working and purchases are paid for with my time. I'm intellectually attracted to being a "scavenger" and making better use of spare resources -- spare computing, spare electricity, spare housing.

<h3> Life situation </h3>
I am a transgender woman-adjacent person. I live alone in the mission district of San Francisco. I am not currently working. It seems reasonably likely this situation will continue in the future.

<h3> Relationship references </h3>
I've had two partners in the past, both of whom I still talk to. The last one is probably willing to talk to you if you want a reference; her name is Vivien Nepenthe (TODO: link twitter). You can also get references from my friends.

<h3> Things I want out of a relationship </h3>
<p>
I want love. I want companionship. I want to build a life with you.
</p>
<p>
I want kids. I've been watching my friend's now-two-year-old as he's grown up. He's very cute.
</p>
<p>
I'm looking for something monogamous, or monagam-ish. I love my friends. I like to be able to snuggle them. I would be sad if I was in a relationship where this was not possible.
</p>
<p>
I'm not really huge on sex at the moment. This is plausibly fixable.
</p>

<h3>Emotions</h3>
Sometimes I get powerful emotions. Power roiling through me. I've written about this on <a href="https://girl.surgery"> my main website </a>. I am likely mildly bipolar -- hypomania for a while with more reclusive periods.
